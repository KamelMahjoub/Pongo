# Pongo

## Game Description
 
 Enjoy the classic game of Pong against a computer or a friend.
 
 Compete in two match modes : 
 
  - ***Goal Limited*** : In this mode, the first player to reach a set amount of goals wins the game.
  
  - ***Time limited*** : In this mode, both players will play for a set amount of time.
                     When the timer reaches 0, the player with most goals wins.
                     The game will end in a draw if both players share the same amount of goals.
 
 Enable powerups for some twists : 
 
 - Powerups will spawn in the middle of the field and will activate if the ball hits them. 
 
 - From having multiballs to changing the size of the players, powerups are sure to add some fun twists and variety to the games.
