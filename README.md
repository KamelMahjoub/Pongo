## About This Project

This project is a recreation of the classic game **Pong**, created for learning purposes and made with **Unity2D**.

In **Pongo**, players can choose to play against another person locally or against an AI-controlled player, with the choice to compete in two **game modes**:

- The first mode is called "***Time limited***". It's a mode where the players compete within a specific time frame,and games may end with one of the players winning or in a draw.
- The second mode is called "***Goal Limited***". It's a mode where the first player to reach a target score wins. 

The game also features **power ups** that can be turned on or off in the match settings screen. These power ups randomly appear in the match at a random position, offering bonuses like extra balls or paddle size changes upon collision with the ball.
